Description:
Produce a list of the quantity of 4 different crab sizes. 
The program will interactively read the size of individual crabs until a negative number is entered. 
Crabs 5.0 up to 5.5 (but not including 5.5 inches are small, 5.5 up to 6.0 (but not including 6.0) are medium and crabs 6.0 and over are
large. Any crab less than 5 inches must be thrown back as non-legal. The output will consist of the total number of crabs and the 
quantity in each of the four categories: illegal, small, medium, large. It will also display the average size of all crabs caught 
and the average size of only the legal crabs caught. You must check for 0 total crabs caught and 0 total legal crabs caught. 

Clarification
The input of this program is interactive (received from the keyboard by the person running the program). 
A negative weight will be the sentinel data. Floating point output must be rounded to 2 places to the right of the decimal point.
